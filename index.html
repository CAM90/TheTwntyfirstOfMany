    <h1>Layouts in D3</h1>
    <p>Layouts in D3 all appear to have a similar creation method, that being typing "d3.name_of_layout(data)." The data is that of an array and seems to be sorted from lowest to highest. Most require both y and x values, only one's that do not need x or y values include the pie chart and the donut layout.</p>
